"A good programmer should acquire
 good algorithms and idioms"

-learn and use in built methods
 before writing and using your own

-Similar to what Sean Parent (senior
 member of adobe software

"So you have all these algorithms at
 your diposal, learn them - thatis very
 impotant" C++ seasoning 2013

"The discretionary exportable
 functionality of entrusted to the
 individual lisp programmer is an order of
 magnitude greater than that to be found
 within Pascal enterprises."

-if you are to acquire a new programming
 language, it should have some clear
 advantage such as speed, readability etc.

# SICP C1
"...the formal parameters are replaced by
 the actual arguments to which the procedure
 is applied"

-a function/method is defined parameters but
 passed arguments
