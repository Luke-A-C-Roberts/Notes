#Driving forces of network architecture and evolution
-The amount of traffic, i.e. the volume of data
-New services, i.e. new ways for people to access technology
-New Technology
	-faster and cheeper computing and comunication
	-network intelligance (networks controll themselves)
	-standardisation of the internet
	-flagship consumer devices shape how networking evolves

#data transmission and network capacity requirements
-buisnesses <-> networking technology
-internet availibility <-> end user increase

#end user factors
LANs in buissnesses have influenced network evolution
-speed of computing power of PCs
-dominance of client-server computing
-centeralized server farms (e.g. the cloud)
-power workgoups (users that need access to large amounts of data)
-high speed local backbone of LANs

WANs in buisnesses also influence network evolution
-less centeralized buissnesses
-larger coorperations and need for data

#comunication model
source -> transmitter -> transmission system -> reciever -> desination
the communication must perform many complex tasks in order to function

this includes:
-Transmision System Util...-> efficient use of transmision facilities
-Interfacing -> comunication with transmission system
-Signal generation -> conversion of data to anologue & digital wave form
-Syncronization -> the transmitter and reciever must be in sync
-Exchange management -> management of prolonged cross-comunication
-Error [detec,correc]tion -> management of incorrect infomation
-Flow controll -> assuring the data emmited wont overwhelm the reciever
-Addressing + routing -> finding the correct destination and path to it
-Recovery -> how to manage errors in terms of communication scheduling
-Message formatting -> allowing the reciever to know the data type
-Security -> assuring that there is no intersception or tampering of data
