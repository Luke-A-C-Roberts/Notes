Useful C Development Tools
===========================

##  C Language Books/ Resources

### Modern C 2nd Eddition - Jens Gustedt

This book goes over every aspect of C11 in detail with excellent pacing. There is a yet to be fully released 3rd eddition going over C23 which has made a few changes to the structure of the book, but both are very useful.

### Deep C - Olve Maudal

A quick slideshow going over common pitfalls and misunderstandings about C sermantics. Useful as a quick read so check it out.

### Language Documentation

Documentation relating to the C (and sometimes C++) language:

[devdocs](https://devdocs.io/c/)
[cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c)
[cplusplus](https://cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/)

##  Other Resources

### The BEAM Book

For looking into the implementation of a complete programmatic virtual machine, The BEAM book is a great resource. There are quite a few C examples that explain the low-level implementation of BEAM and the ERTS.
