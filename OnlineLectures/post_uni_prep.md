Learning how you learn and getting the engineering roles.

[Excelling in the Engineering field - Learning how you learn and getting the engineering roles.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLh_tkWe8sg&t=2590s)

# Keep the learning fires lit

- Talk to people in industry and online about the line of work

- Value is quality and speed of a solution. To be a good engineer one must:
  - Know the best technologies for a problem domain
  - Know how to troubleshoot problems well
  - Be able to plan effectively with others. This value must be maintained and improved indefinately

# Continuing Education

- One best practice is *read the field manual* (RtFM)
  the amount of problems aren't effectively solved because of this is unfortunate

- Learn how you learn (Metalearning)

- **Do Certifications**

- Home labs. Work on professional and private projects.

- Networking with people and colaboration

- Mentor others

# Metalearning

- Manage time effectively

- Watching videos (i.e. online lectures) preferably at ×1.5+ speeds to maximise time usage

- Listening to technology podcasts

- Make time for learning rather than just try to fit it in to a schedule

- Daily work is better than cramming. Studying early in the day is better than later in the afternoon/night

- Learn my learning style to better suit my own needs

- Self assessment of what I enjoy doing is important. Don't study that which is boring

- Determine what level of profficiency I am at a particular dicipline.
  - Bloom's taxonomy. What level of sophistication am I right now?
  - Concience/Compitance. Do I do a task (in)competantly and do I do is (un)consciously. People often start at incompitant/unconcious move to incompitent/concious then compitent/concious and finally become an expert with competantly and unconciously performing a task. This however is a trap as engineers must remain concious because technology continues to move.

# Certifications

Keyterm: BOK - body of knowledge

Specific certifications
ISC²
 - Sunflower document?
 - Certified in cybercecurity
 - 8 Domains of CISSP

COMPTIA
 - Net+
 - Sec+ - well respected in industry
 - Cloud+
 - Data+

Linux Foundation - Quite intense examination
 - CKA
 - CKAD
 - CKS

AWS and microsoft certs

General Engineering
 - Six sigma process improvement (whitebelt) as well as other belts (not free but training is)
 - [API lifestyle and security (Three courses)](https://apiacademy.co)

Hurricane Electric - [he.net](https://ipv6.he.net/certification/)

Gremlin Engineering - Cert nolonger availiable but training is

[All hands on labs](https://killercoda.com)

# Home Lab

 - Spend time building out equiptment of software that can emulate a industry setup

 - Labs using servers to work on API skills can be created for really cheep

# Immersion

 - Listen to technology podcasts

 - Slack, Discord etc. can be used for technical discussion on interesting topic

 - Opensource projects

 - [free online labs](https://killercoda.com)

 - government resources can be useful
